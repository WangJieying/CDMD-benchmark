# CDMD-benchmark

This benchmark is the supplementary material of the paper "Quantitative Evaluation of Dense Skeletons for Image Compression".

The benchmark contains our 100-image database with 10 different image types, each having 10 images.

For each image, we provide

- the original (color) image
- its grayscale (luminance-only) variant
- the compression results obtained by our method (CDMD)


For each type, we draw the scatter plot to show the trade-off between MS-SSIM and CR.
